An Arithmetic Geometric sequence
Problem 235
Given is the arithmetic-geometric sequence u(k) = (900-3k)rk-1.
Let s(n) = Î£k=1...nu(k).

Find the value of r for which s(5000) = -600,000,000,000.

Give your answer rounded to 12 places behind the decimal point.

Notes on problem 235():
There is a way to actually write a closed form formula for S(n).
But, python is quick enough that this is not needed.
The output is tricky, with prec = 13, we get 12 decimals
but it is rounded down. So, the output should be raised by one.
