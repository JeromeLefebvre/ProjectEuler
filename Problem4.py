'''
Largest palindrome product
Problem 4
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# A palidrome made of 6 digits is an divisible by 11
# As abccba = a*10**5 + b*10**4 + c*10**3 + c*10**2 + b*10 + a = -a + b - c + c - b + a = 0 mod 11
# So, 11 divides either i or j.
